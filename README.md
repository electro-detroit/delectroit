Mapping Memory Challenge 2025
To add the code for each marker and code, copy and past these lines of code 5 times for your markers.
Then edit the lat and long according to your location, and change the name of the marker in the second line of code.
var marker = L.marker([42.3280226, -83.0448932]).addTo(map);
marker.bindPopup("<b><center>Venue Name</center></b>Pop Up Information here.");
To add the latitude and longitude for each marker and pop-up, download the RAW file from the data set in Github. 
This makes copying and pasting the lat and long into each line of code for the markers much easier.
